## Build system
On the current Node.js application, hot reload is enabled then you 
don't need to build app after change. But in case of change inside docker 
files you need to build using command:

```bash
    make build
```

## Run system
We can easily run whole project using command:
```bash
    make run
```

## Stop system
We can easily stop project using command:
```bash
    make down
```
